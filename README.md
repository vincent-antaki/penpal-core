# Core Library

The `core` Python package for Penpal creative coding sketches.

## Overview

This directory contains the shared utilities, drawing abstractions, and mathematical components needed by the individual sketches. Centralizing these tools ensures consistency and reusability across all projects.

## Installation

The `core` directory is set up to be managed via `uv`. The main `runner.py` from the monorepo root automatically resolves these dependencies for the sketches.
